<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, I'm Cheniya Pibool, but you can just call me Chenya. I've had quite the journey so 
  farâ€”graduating top of my class in Economics from Srinakarinwirot University, dipping my toes in 
  the corporate world as a Compliance Officer at Bangkok Bank, and later diving into the whirlwind 
  of Service Operations. But my story took a turn when I decided to hit the pause button and jet off 
  to Australia for a language adventure. Eight months of Aussie vibes, English immersion, and a ton 
  of unforgettable experiences later, I returned to Thailand with a fresh perspective and a new career 
  path in mind.</p>

<p>Back home, I made the leap into the world of web development. It's been an exhilarating ride diving 
  into the world of coding and design. I'm currently on a mission to become a Full Stack Developer, 
  soaking up every bit of knowledge and skill along the way. From crunching numbers to crafting code, 
  I'm all about exploring new horizons and pushing boundaries.

<p>So, what brings you here? Whether you're curious about web development, looking to collaborate, or 
  just fancy a chat, I'm all ears. Let's connect and see where the journey takes us!</p>
